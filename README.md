# AdventJS Solutions 2024 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions for the [AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/es) challenges - a programming advent calendar created by [midudev](https://www.twitch.tv/midudev).

## What is AdventJS?

AdventJS is a series of daily programming challenges released during December, similar to Advent of Code but focused on JavaScript/TypeScript. Created by the Spanish streamer midudev, it provides a fun way to improve your programming skills during the holiday season.
